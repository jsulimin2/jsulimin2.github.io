			<p>It was the Sunday afternoon before the first day of school. I had gone with the college students on impulse. The sky
				was a deep, fathomless blue and piercing sunlight dissipated into gentle heat as clouds interposed themselves between
				us. I bask in the last fading rays of summer and lunge at my sister.</p>

			<p>Taken exactly a year apart, these pictures embody why I stare at the sky.
				The first time, I'm baffled. What is that rainbow around the sun? I take photos blindly, the dazzling sunlight
				obscuring my view of the screen. I'm transfixed the rest of the way home. The second time, I'm ecstatic. Sun halo!
			I exclaim. My mother hums noncommittally.</p>
